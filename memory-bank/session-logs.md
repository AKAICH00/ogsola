## Session Notes (Current Timestamp - Use Actual Date/Time)

*   **Action:** Created placeholder module structure for C Development Simulation.
*   **Location:** `src/lib/c_simulator/`
*   **Files Created:**
    *   `index.ts`: Main handler for agent interaction.
    *   `types.ts`: Type definitions for simulated C elements and commands.
    *   `generator.ts`: Functions to generate C code snippets and simulate compilation.
    *   `parser.ts`: Placeholder for request parsing.
    *   `state.ts`: Placeholder for managing simulated project state.
*   **Purpose:** To provide a framework for simulating C game development workflow and interaction via the agent (SIGMA) as part of the project's lore, without actual C compilation/execution in the browser. Ready for future implementation.
